- **Projects Section** with cards linking to project demos or repositories
- **Contact Section** with social icons and hover animations
- Fully **mobile-friendly** using Tailwind CSS responsive utilities

## Technologies Used
- **React** – for building UI components
- **Tailwind CSS** – for styling and responsive design
- **React Icons** – for social and technology icons
- **GitHub Pages** – for deployment

## Project Structure
The project is organized in a clean and modular way. All React components, including the Navbar, Hero section, Projects, and Contact section, are placed inside the `components` folder. The `data` folder contains static data for the projects and the tech stack, allowing easy updates without modifying the components. All images, icons, and other assets are stored in the `assets` folder. This structure makes the code easy to maintain, scalable, and readable.
